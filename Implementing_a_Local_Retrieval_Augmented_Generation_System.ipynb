This approach is inspired by the way humans learn, starting with simple concepts and building upon them. In the context provided, it is mentioned that this technique has its roots in the early study of neural networks, particularly in Jeffrey Elman's 1993 paper. Bengio et al. demonstrated successful application of curriculum learning in image classification tasks, such as identifying geometric shapes with increasingly complex forms, and language modeling tasks, such as training with a gradually expanding vocabulary.

            " Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) is a type of web tracking that groups people into \"cohorts\" based on their browsing history for the purpose of interest-based advertising. It was being developed as a part of Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, which includes several other advertising-related technologies with bird-themed names. FLoC was being tested in Chrome 89 as a replacement for third-party cookies. Despite \"federated learning\" in the name, FLoC does not utilize any federated learning. FLoC improves data privacy by grouping people into cohorts based on their browsing history, rather than tracking individual users. This means that advertisers can still target users based on their interests, but without the need for individual user data.\n"
